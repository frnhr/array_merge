# Array merge

A test task for a project, nothing interesting here...

## What is "array"?

Word "array" doesn't mean much in Python. Closest to arrays in C are 
lists in Python.

But there are other iterable things in Python that are not list 
(because if it quacks like a duck...) so another way to translate "array" to 
Python is to say "Iterable".
